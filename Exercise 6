--Creating views 
--Views work similarly like stored procedure, they contain codes that can be called and executed like a function.
--Views only contain SELECT statements 

--Question 1
CREATE VIEW guideOrderby AS												                    --'guideTableView' is the name of the view 
SELECT TOP 100 PERCENT LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, PHONE_NUM, HIRE_DATE		-- you cant use an ORDER BY in a view, to use it you must include 'TOP 100 PERCENT' at the start of your select statement
